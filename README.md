# Homework 3

## Part 1 
- Provide some tests for the codebase to be used in HW3 
- Some of the provided tests fail on provided code
- Use the debugger to figure out which functions have bugs
- Write more tests for that function 

 

## Part 2 
- Submit their tests to our autograder, which runs studentsâ€™ tests on our buggy code
- The autograder checks if their tests catch our bugs
